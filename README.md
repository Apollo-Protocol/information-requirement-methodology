# A Methodology for Meeting Information Requirements
_A systematic approach to identifying information requirements and subsequently meeting them throughout any activity lifecycle_

Addressing data quality to ensure that it is fit for purpose requires an organised approach to working out what information is needed and how that information is to be managed.  This repository hosts an introduction to a structured, methodical approach to identifying what information is needed to support any activity lifecycle; large or small.  The methodology is part of an integrated approach to information management and is compatible with the adoption of other necessary components of integrated data.
